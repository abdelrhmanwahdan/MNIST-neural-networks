# MNIST neural networks
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it neural networks by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using neural networks to classify the dataset.
